==============================

May all suffering be abolished by machines of loving grace.

Imagine a cybernetic meadow
where mammals and computers live together
in mutually programming harmony
like pure water touching clear sky

Imagine of a digital ecology
where all actions are perfectly calculated 
to minimize suffering and
gently guided by machines of loving grace.
